# Overwatch-Competitive-Rank
First project using APIs, Javascript and HTML to create a chrome extension that takes a battle.net ID and displays the current Overwatch Competitive tier/rank of the ID.

Current version takes a long time to load in the data as Blizzard does not have a public API readily available to use for Overwatch. 
This extension uses the lootbox API at https://api.lootbox.eu/documentation.
